# ðŸ’¨ Dashboard using ReactJS and Firebase ðŸ’¨ 
## [DEMO](http://ec2-3-129-209-179.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)

## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the NGT's Frontend Developer Test. The goal of this test is to create a small dashboard with a page that displays a summary of multiple
results. The app consumes the data from the Firebase database and display it in a mini front-end dashboard. The app should include the following features:

- **Converted results to a json structure**
- **JavaScript, ReactJS and UIkit**
- **Firebase Realtime Database**
- **Nice commit messages**
- **Working code**
- **Readme**



It is a ReactJS Web-App using Firebase as a backend database..
